1. Purpose

The purpose of this system is to build a secure and scalable backend application that provides user authentication, role-based access control, and CRUD operations on a secondary entity.
A basic frontend UI will be developed to interact with and test the backend APIs.

2. Scope

The system will include:

Backend APIs built using Node.js and Express.js

Database management using MongoDB with Mongoose

JWT-based authentication

Role-based authorization (User & Admin)

CRUD operations for a secondary entity (Tasks)

A simple React.js frontend for API interaction

3. User Roles
3.1 Admin

Can log in

Can access all APIs

Can create, read, update, and delete tasks

Can delete any user-created task

3.2 User

Can register and log in

Can access protected APIs

Can create, read, and update their own tasks

Cannot delete tasks created by other users

4. Functional Requirements
4.1 Authentication & Authorization

Users must be able to register using email and password

Users must be able to log in using registered credentials

Passwords must be stored in hashed format

On successful login, a JWT token must be issued

Protected routes must require a valid JWT

Role-based access must restrict actions based on user role

4.2 User Management

System shall store user details:

Name

Email (unique)

Password (hashed)

Role (user/admin)

Duplicate email registration must be prevented

4.3 Task Management (CRUD Operations)

Authenticated users can:

Create a task

View their tasks

Update their tasks

Admin users can:

View all tasks

Update any task

Delete any task

Each task shall include:

Title

Description

Status (pending/completed)

Created By (user reference)

Created At timestamp

4.4 API Versioning

All APIs must follow versioning:

/api/v1/...

4.5 Error Handling & Validation

Input validation must be performed on all API requests

System must return proper HTTP status codes:

200 – Success

201 – Resource Created

400 – Bad Request

401 – Unauthorized

403 – Forbidden

404 – Not Found

500 – Internal Server Error

Error messages must be meaningful and consistent

4.6 API Documentation

APIs must be documented using Swagger or Postman

Documentation should include:

Endpoint details

Request/response examples

Authentication requirements

5. Frontend Functional Requirements

Users must be able to:

Register

Log in

Access a protected dashboard

Perform CRUD operations on tasks

JWT token must be attached to API requests

UI must display success and error messages from APIs

6. Security Requirements

Passwords must never be stored in plain text

JWT tokens must be securely signed and validated

Protected routes must not be accessible without authentication

Input sanitization must prevent malicious inputs

7. Scalability & Maintainability

Modular backend structure must allow easy addition of new modules

Stateless authentication using JWT

API versioning for future enhancements

Optional support for:

Caching (Redis)

Logging

Docker-based deployment
